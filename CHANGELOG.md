## Features

- borders can now be drawn both as textures or as a solid color
- GCD underlay color settings now include alpha
- both GCD markers can now be enabled and disabled
- users can now choose to display swing timer or attack speed texts on the left or right of the bar, or not at all

## Fixes

- text on the left and right now always displays one decimal place
- extra logic for more haste detection for GCD with Flash of Light
- textures on the bar now have a fixed scale by default and are no longer stretched (particularly obvious with the default Blizzard skins)
