## Install Instructions

It is recommended to install the addon from either Curseforge via the Curse Client, or from the Wago.io provider on the WoWUp Client:

This way, your addon will be automatically updated when a new release comes out.

If you want to install the addon manually, simply download the `SwedgeTimer.zip` file from the latest release on [the releases page](https://github.com/hypernormalisation/SwedgeTimer/releases).

## Usage Instructions

SwedgeTimer's config can be opened with the slashcommand `\st` in the chat box, or via the addon interface options in the WoW menu.
